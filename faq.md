# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the goal of FAQ?
* The goal of this movement is to build coalitions amongst those most affected by injustices. 

## Why build coalitions of those most affected by injustices?
* Those most affected by injustice have the least power available to solve the problems they face. Those in power either have little to gain, or will actively undermine their own position of privilege or power by confronting injustice. This means it is problematic to rely on those in positions of power to solve injustices with the urgency and the severity of current problems.
* Those most affected by injustice possess a unique and previously unheard of perspective that is essential to designing solutions to the systemic problems that oppress them. It is essential to also develop intellectual thought that originates from those faced by injustice, and identify where alignment and inconsistencies emerge compared to thought developed from positions of power and privilege. Only with a more diverse set of perspectives and ideas can we design system interventions that dismantle systemic injustice.
* The existing solution space for the systemic problems that cause injustice is limited because only those with power and privilege are in a position to contribute. This lack of diversity allows blind spots to go unnoticed, and the solutions proposed by the privileged will invariably perpetuate their privilege at the expense of injustice.


## Why is it likely that this approach will piss off those with the privilege to have a voice and to have power?
* As an oppressed one, the act of speaking out and claiming an open intellectual space will delegitimise those that have a claim to their voice or their power through privilege. Those that understand this dynamic, embrace inclusivity, and value other protective, will learn and accept the oppressed speaking out. Those that are not willing to question their legitimacy as thought leaders through their privilege, will resist and will not accept that the oppressed speak out. They will claim that you can only participate in a conversation if you adhere to the same intellectual legacy that they themselves adhere to- a standpoint that inherently is never open to new perspectives and ideas. Which is a fundamentally unscientific viewpoint.
* This is something that those who have championed fights against oppression, will invariably have experienced. An oppressed group will hardly ever be voluntarily given the legitimacy and recognition of being allowed to speak out, much less being in charge of designing solutions to the problems they face, even though they are uniquely equipped to design solutions to the systemic issues they face.
